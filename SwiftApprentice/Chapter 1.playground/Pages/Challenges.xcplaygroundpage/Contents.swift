//Variables and constants chapter playground

//Challenge 1: Variables

let myAge = 16
let varDogs = 0 + 1


//Challenge 2: Make it compile.

var age = 16
print(age)
age = 30
print(age)

// switched it from being a constant to a variable


//Challenge 3: Compuete the answer

let x: Int = 46
let y: Int = 10



// 1
let answer1: Int = (x * 100) + y
// (46 * 100) + 10
// 4610

// 2
let answer2: Int = (x * 100) + (y * 100)
// ( 46 * 100) + (10 * 100)
// 4600 + 1000
// 5600

// 3
let answer3: Int = (x * 100) + (y / 10)
// (46 * 100) + (10/10)
// 4600 + 1
// 4601


//Challenge 4 - the parathenses challenge
(8 - 4) * 2 + 6 / 3 * 4


//Challenge 5: Average rating


let rating1: Double = 2.0

let rating2: Double = 3.0

let rating3: Double = 4.0

(rating1 + rating2 + rating3) /3.0 = AverageRating


//Challenge 6: Electrical power

The power of an electrical appliance can be calculated by multiplying the voltage by
the current. Declare a constant named voltage of type Double and assign it a value.
Then declare a constant called current of type Double and assign it a value. Finally
calculate the power of the electrical appliance you’ve just created storing it in a
constant called power of type Double.
 

let voltage: Double = 1.0

let Current: Double = 2.0

voltage * Current = Power

 
 


let Power: Double = 2.0


//Challenge 7 Electrical Resistance (don't know how to solve it)


/*The resistance of such an appliance can be then calculated (in a long-winded way) as
the power divided by the current squared. Calculate the resistance and store it in a
constant called resistance of type Double
 
 





//Challenge 8 Random integer (don't know how to solve it)

You can create a random integer number by using the function arc4random(). This
creates a number anywhere between 0 and 4294967295. You can use the modulo
operator to truncate this random number to whatever range you want. Declare a
constant randomNumber and assign it a random number generated with
arc4random(). Then calculate a constant called diceRoll and use the random
number you just found to create a random number between 1 and 6.
 
 arc4random()
 
 let randomNumber = >>
 
 let diceRoll =
 
 

 
 Challenge 9 (don't know how to solve)
 A quadratic equation is something of the form a⋅x² + b⋅x + c = 0. The values of x
which satisfy this can be solved by using the equation x = (-b ± sqrt(b² -
4⋅a⋅c)) / (2⋅a). Declare three constants named a, b and c of type Double. Then
calculate the two values for x using the equation above (noting that the ± means plus
or minus — so one value of x for each). Store the results in constants called root1
and root2 of type Double.
 

 a =
 
 
÷
