Int myAge = 16

var averageAge: Double 16

let testNumber = 14

let evenOdd = testNumber

var answer = (0 + 10) * 10 >> 3 



//1. Declare a constant of type Int called myAge and set it to your age.
//2. Declare a variable of type Double called averageAge. Initially, set it to your own
//age. Then, set it to the average of your age and my own age of 30.
//3. Create a constant called testNumber and initialize it with whatever integer you’d
//like. Next, create another constant called evenOdd and set it equal to testNumber
//modulo 2. Now change testNumber to various numbers. What do you notice
//about evenOdd?
//4. Create a variable called answer and initialize it with the value 0. Increment it by
//1. Add 10 to it. Multiply it by 10.
